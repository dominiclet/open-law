## Installing all node module dependencies
Installed axios, and the package.json file is updated. Remember to run `npm install`.

## Virtual environment and installing python requirements
Added `__pycache__` and `venv` to `.gitignore` so they won't be pushed.
Can install requirements using `requirements.txt`.
